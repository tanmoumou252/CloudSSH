> [!TIP]
> **CloudSSH** utilizes Cloudflare Workers' TCP Sockets support to handle SSH protocol parsing and forwarding at edge nodes, providing a low-latency Web Terminal experience.

## Demo

> Imagine opening your browser anytime, anywhere, and connecting to your server with a highly futuristic cyberpunk UI, without installing any SSH client.

## Highlights

### Ultimate Serverless

- **Zero Server Cost**: Pure frontend deployment + Cloudflare Workers, no need to build your own backend servers.
- **Edge Acceleration**: Benefit from Cloudflare's global edge network, enjoying low-latency SSH connections from anywhere.

### Out of the Box

- **One-Click Deployment**: Build and deploy the project with a single command using the Wrangler CLI.
- **Modern Frontend Stack**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS, paired with xterm.js to provide a silky smooth terminal experience.

### Secure and Reliable

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Complete implementation of the SSH-2.0 protocol, including ECDH key exchange, Ed25519 signature authentication, and AES-256-GCM data encryption.
- **Security Hardening**: Built-in SSRF protection against IPv6 and reserved IPs, API rate limiting (anti-brute force), and local AES-GCM encryption for your stored server credentials.
- **Isolated Session State**: Leveraging Cloudflare Durable Objects and the Hibernation API, every terminal session runs securely and persistently within its sandbox.

<a id="features"></a>
## Features

- **Full SSH Handshake**: Native TypeScript implementation of the SSH transport layer and user authentication protocols.
- **IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack**: Full support for both IPv4 and IPv6 address connections, including automatic handling of IPv6 bracket notation.
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Supports standard SSH password authentication as well as Ed25519 plaintext private key authentication.
- **MitM Protection (TOFU)**: Automatically extracts and prints the server's Host Key (SHA-256 fingerprint) on the first connection, preventing eavesdropping by malicious nodes.
- **Geek Terminal Experience**: Powered by `@xterm/xterm` and the `@xterm/addon-webgl` hardware acceleration rendering engine, ensuring silky smooth scrolling even with massive log outputs.
- **Customizable UI**: Switch seamlessly between classic terminal themes like Cyberpunk, Glacier, and Gruvbox, fully optimized for mobile devices.
- **Native File Transfer**: Integrated with `zmodem.js`. Just run `rz` or `sz` commands in the terminal to easily upload/download files via drag & drop directly in the browser.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Browser["Browser Client<br/>(React + xterm.js)"]
    CF["Cloudflare Edge Network"]
    DO["Durable Object<br/>(SSH Session Management)"]
    Server["Target SSH Server<br/>(e.g., Linux VPS)"]

    Browser <-->|"WebSocket<br/>(Frontend UI Input & Terminal Output)"| CF
    CF <-->|"WebSocket"<br/>Routing & Long-lived Connection| DO
    DO <-->|"TCP Socket<br/>@cloudflare/sockets"| Server
```

1. The user enters the host IP, username, and password on the frontend.
2. The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection with the backend Durable Object.
3. The DO receives the credentials and establishes a TCP connection with the target SSH server using `@cloudflare/sockets`.
4. The DO handles the entire SSH protocol negotiation (key exchange, password auth, etc.) in pure code and forwards the encrypted terminal data to the frontend via WebSocket.

## Quick Deployment

### Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account.
- Node.js environment (v18+).
- Cloudflare Workers Free Plan enabled (required for TCP Sockets and Durable Objects features).

### Steps

#### Method 1: Deploy via GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Configure Domain**: Before deploying, you must modify the custom domain in `wrangler.toml` to your own domain (Note: The domain must be registered or active in Cloudflare beforehand).
3. **Setup Deployment**: Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard, go to Workers & Pages to connect your GitHub account, and select the forked repository.
4. **Build Command**: During the deployment configuration, make sure to enter `npm install && npm run build:frontend` as the Build command, then deploy with one click (the build output directory can be left blank).

#### Method 2: Local CLI Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newbietan/CloudSSH.git
   cd CloudSSH
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Login to Cloudflare**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```

4. **One-Click Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

Once deployed, Wrangler will output your Worker URL. Open that URL in your browser to start using your Web SSH terminal.

## Development

This project consists of two parts:
1. **Frontend**: Located in the `frontend/` directory, built with Vite.
2. **Worker**: Located in the `src/` directory, containing the Cloudflare Worker entry point and the core SSH protocol implementation.

For local development, you can run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command starts Wrangler's local development environment server.
